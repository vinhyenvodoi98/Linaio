## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
This project provides an auction platform of custom products for crypto fans. Currently, the product will include the nike air force 1 shoe tokenized into nft . After the auction is done, we will contact the user to collect email and the shoes will be shipped in 2 to 3 weeks. in case the auction ends and no one bets the product will be sold at the openning price. We have a special feature is that unsuccessful bidders will be refunded get a little bonus. In addition, there will be a winner announcement event trigger, who will also be entitled to a bonus. We wanted to create a place where artists customizing shoes or other blockchain products could sold the physical version. Anyone who participates will get their benefits
